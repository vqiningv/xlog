##xlog


Enhanced glog for Go.

This is an enhancement to the google Go implementation of leveled logs in the manner of the open source C++ package https://github.com/google/glog

By binding methods to booleans it is possible to use the log package without paying the expense of evaluating the arguments to the log.

Through the -vmodule flag, the package also provides fine-grained control over logging at the file level.

The usage is just similar to glog.
	
Basic examples:
	
		xlog.Info("Prepare to repel boarders")
	
		xlog.Fatalf("Initialization failed: %s", err)
	
See the documentation for the V function for an explanation	of these examples:
	
		if xlog.V(2) {
			xlog.Info("Starting transaction...")
		}
	
		xlog.V(2).Infoln("Processed", nItems, "elements")
